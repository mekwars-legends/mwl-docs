MOTD:


Welcome to The Draconis Combine
Founded in the 24th century by Shiro Kurita, the Draconis Combine is a modern day embodiment of Tokugawa Japan. The Coordinator, like the Shoguns of old, carefully balances a realm ruled by semi-autonomous Warlords possessing their own loyal armies. He is aided in this endeavor by spies, secret societies, ninja, and loyal retainers. The Dragon's subjects hold thoughts of honor and duty, driving even the criminal and outcast to passionate service of the realm. Most importantly, the spirit of the samurai lives within the souls of the Dragon's soldiers, motivating them to feats of bravery, sacrifice, and slaughter beyond what most would call sane.

Welcome to DC everyone. If you have any questions feel free to ask and be sure to request access to the DC forums.

[23:27] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: and as you go through, make sure that autoeject is disabled
[23:27] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: (right click, disable autoeject)
[23:27] 5th Sword of Light [DC]: Why?
[23:28] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: autoeject is great for saving pilots
[23:28] 5th Sword of Light [DC]: (I guess I know why, but have to ask)
[23:28] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: however a single hit to the HD from a cluster weapon could cause an autoeject
[23:28] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: So a pefectly capable mech is lost
[23:28] 5th Sword of Light [DC]: I can order manual eject?
[23:28] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: Yes
[23:29] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: there are scenarios where you want autoeject
[23:29] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: but for now, switch it off
[23:29] 5th Sword of Light [DC]: ok
[23:34] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: Before you can start a battle, you'll need to create an army
[23:34] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: an army needs a few things:
[23:35] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: greater than 8000bv
[23:35] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: have a commander
[23:35] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: be legal
[23:35] 5th Sword of Light [DC]: How do i get a commander?
[23:35] 5th Sword of Light [DC]: What's legal?
[23:35] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: you set one
[23:36] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: I'll fill that bit in as we go
[23:36] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: for now click the create new army button
[23:36] 5th Sword of Light [DC]: Done
[23:36] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: now you can drag and drop units into the army
[23:37] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: a commander has to be a unit of the highest weightclass
[23:37] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: you set the commander by right clicking and select 'set commander'
[23:38] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: there's a few points on legality
[23:39] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: your army must meet the 50% rule. Which is that 50% of your army must be from the heavy and medium classes
[23:39] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: The link to the commander and 50% rule is up in our Message of the Day (MOTD)
[23:40] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: you can show your army to your faction at any time by right clicking in the panel to the left and select show to faction
[23:41] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: I highly recommend the 'Rhubarbs Unit viewer' in those collection of links as well
[23:42] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: where are you up to?
[23:43] 5th Sword of Light [DC]: Reading up on the two rules
[23:43] 5th Sword of Light [DC]: But i'll have to leave in a few minutes
[23:43] 5th Sword of Light [DC]: can i just pull everything into the army?
[23:43] 5th Sword of Light [DC]: Is there saome upper limit?
[23:44] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: You can. It'll be around 60-70k though
[23:44] 5th Sword of Light [DC]: that a problem?
[23:44] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: you'll just need someone to fight
[23:44] 5th Sword of Light [DC]: Right :D
[23:44] 5th Sword of Light [DC]: I understand
[23:45] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: we have ranks here. There's a 5% difference in bv between ranks
[23:45] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: so for a vet to fight a regular, they need to be 5% less bv than you
[23:45] 5th Sword of Light [DC]: I see
[23:47] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: Any questions?
[23:47] 5th Sword of Light [DC]: Once I have an army
[23:47] 5th Sword of Light [DC]: How do I move to battle?
[23:48] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: Good question
[23:48] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: that big power button in the lower right
[23:49] 5th Sword of Light [DC]: I can only have 10 units in the army?
[23:49] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: No, it'll add a new line
[23:50] 5th Sword of Light [DC]: Right :)
[23:50] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: Once you've been in battle, those units are locked until you complete your MC
[23:50] 5th Sword of Light [DC]: My army: - MR-V3 [4/5], Sabra XIII [4/5], Raptor RTX1-OF [4/5], HM-1 [4/5], SDR-9KC [4/5], PNT-12A [4/5], HCT-7A [4/5], HCT-5K [4/5], WVR-8K [4/5], LNX-9Q [4/5], Avatar AV1-OC [4/5], DAI-03 [4/5], CPLT-K5 [4/5], ARC-9K [4/5GT]; BV: 18996
[23:51] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: your PNT is set to a commander
[23:51] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: see how it is in italics
[23:51] 5th Sword of Light [DC]: Is that bad?
[23:52] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: commanders have to be of the highest weight class
[23:52] 5th Sword of Light [DC]: I thought i read i can have a commander per lance
[23:52] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: Yes, but of the highest weightclass
[23:52] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: have you used TSM before?
[23:52] 5th Sword of Light [DC]: What is TSM?
[23:53] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: Tripple Strength Myomer
[23:53] 5th Sword of Light [DC]: Remember it from the books
[23:53] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: the HCT-7A
[23:53] 5th Sword of Light [DC]: I can see it, yes
[23:53] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: http://www.sarna.net/wiki/TSM
[23:54] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: essentially, you'll need to get it to 9 over heat and you'll get extra movement and double physical damage
[23:55] 5th Sword of Light [DC]: got it :)
[23:55] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: So round 1, get it to 29 heat.
[23:55] 5th Sword of Light [DC]: So, back to commander question, if I only have one assault mech I can have only one commander. If three, than 3?
[23:56] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: No
[23:56] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: 1 commander per lance of 8 meks
[23:56] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: highest weight class first
[23:57] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: so if your highest weightclass is assault. you'll have an assault commander
[23:57] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: My army: - SDR-9KB [4/5], GUN-2ERD [4/5], CPLT-K4 [4/5QS], Maxim Heavy Hover Transport (C3S) [4/5], Maxim Heavy Hover Transport (C3S) [4/5], CPLT-A1 [4/5], Kanazuchi [3NAG], Kanazuchi [4]; BV: 9890
[23:58] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: your second commander would have to be a heavy
[23:58] 5th Sword of Light [DC]: does it give a bonus if my commander also has c3 master?
[23:58] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: no
[23:58] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: it gives a bonus to initiative
[23:59] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: also forms part of the victory rules
[23:59] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: .. As in, to win the battle you need to destroy their commander as well as 85% of the opposing force
[23:59] 5th Sword of Light [DC]: What is the "standard" BV of an army?
[00:00] 5th Sword of Light [DC]: Apperentaly i should aim for some number if I wish to fight someone
[00:00] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: Depends
[00:00] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: we have a double blind system, so you don't know who you're going to fight
[00:00] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: you can however advertise that you're looking to fight
[00:01] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: I'd recommend that you build armies between 8.5-9.5k
[00:01] 5th Sword of Light [DC]: That's what I was asking :)
[00:01] 5th Sword of Light [DC]: Thanks
[00:01] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: sorry, I do waffle on a bit ;)
[00:01] 5th Sword of Light [DC]: don't worry it's ok
[00:02] 5th Sword of Light [DC]: So, since I have lot mory mechs than what I can field in an army
[00:02] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: Click Create New army
[00:02] 5th Sword of Light [DC]: I can have multiple armies built for different "profiles"
[00:02] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: Yes
[00:03] 5th Sword of Light [DC]: and choose which to fight with?
[00:03] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: you'll build a c3 army
[00:03] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: .. for example

[00:04] 5th Sword of Light [DC]: I push the green button
[00:04] 5th Sword of Light [DC]: and then?...
[00:04] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: Wait for the bells to go off
[00:05] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: you'll then goto the current battles tab, and select a server to join
[00:05] 5th Sword of Light [DC]: Do I choose an objective, like which planet to fight for?
[00:05] 11th Legion of Vega [DC]: If you have the attack, you'll chose the objective. Stick to advances
