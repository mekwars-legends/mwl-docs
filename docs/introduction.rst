About Mekwars: Legends
----------------------

About this Manual
-----------------

This manual is meant to help you understand how this server works and prepare you before you get tossed into the water with the sharks. As you are probably new to the Mekwars: Legends Server there are a number of things you should pay attention to.

The metagame of planetary conquest and strategy is a very important part of the server life and the Faction communities. Some players put a lot of effort into this aspect of the game. Please consider this, before you rush headlong into battle. The results of your fights will impact on the strategic map, both positive and negative. You can do tremendous damage to your Faction – and all its other players - by unknowingly doing the wrong things, which could destroy the hard work of others.

.. note:: Note: Don't let this discourage you!

We (the players of Mekwars: Legends) realize that this isn't done with bad intentions. Nevertheless, we would truly appreciate that if you have any questions, ask one of the veterans before you go into battle. And keep asking those questions. All of us, your factionmates and opponents alike, want to get your feet planted on solid ground, so that you can eventually hold your own on this server.

* Ask! This server has a strong roster of experienced veterans that are more than willing to give you a hand or answer your questions. Most of them have been around for years and will very probably have an answer to your question.
* The MWL campaign is set up to reward fast, constant play, instead of multiple hour games where you snipe an entire lance with a Griffin.
* It's not uncommon for a player here to play half a dozen games a day. These are people that see the battlefield from multiple perspectives and a variety of strategies.  These guys (and sometimes, ladies) can often have every unit ever produced, committed to memory – and they are waiting to pound on hapless victims!!!
* While taking your first steps you should build armies around 8,500 to 9,500 BV. In this bracket you will find plenty of games. As a new player your rating will give you a % advantage over more experienced players to level the field a bit. It will also allow you to play your first games without fear of losing, or incurring the wrath of your faction mates.
* Expect every trick in the book or ever thought of! And make sure that you learn them yourself.
* Take your time. Don´t go for shortcuts – it's the surest way to ruin a promising situation and the rest of your day.

Learning the game will not only help your faction, but you'll also enjoy your games more. It's a fact that you won't enjoy your time in Mekwars: Legends if you keep losing battles and having bad experiences.
