About this Manual
-----------------

This manual is meant to help you understand how this server works and prepare you before you get tossed into the water with the sharks. As you are probably new to the Mekwars Legends Server there are a number of things you should pay attention to.

The metagame of planetary conquest and strategy is a very important part of the server life and the Faction communities. Some players put a lot of effort into this aspect of the game. Please consider this, before you rush headlong into battle. The results of your fights will impact on the strategic map, both positive and negative. You can do tremendous damage to the Faction – and all its other players - by unknowingly doing the wrong things and destroy the hard work of others.

.. note:: Note: Don't let this discourage you!

We (the other players of your faction) realize that this isn´t done by bad intention, nevertheless we would really appreciate, if you ask one of our veterans, before you go into battle and keep asking. It is our goal to get your feet planted on solid ground and hold your own on this server. You will not enjoy your games, if you keep having bad experiences and loosing battles.

* Ask! This server has a strong roster of experienced veterans that are more than willing to give you a hand or answer your questions. Most of them have been around for years and will very probably have an answer to your question.
* The MWL campaign is set up to reward fast, constant play, instead of multiple hour games where you snipe an entire lance with a Griffin.
* It's not uncommon for a player here to play half a dozen games a day. These are people that see the battlefield from multiple perspectives and a variety of strategies.  These guys (rarely ladies) have every unit, ever produced, committed to memory – and they are waiting to pound on hapless victims!!!
* While taking your first steps you should build armies around 9.500BV. In this bracket you will find plenty of games. As a new player your rating will give you a % advantage over more experienced players to level the field a bit. It will also allow you to play your first games without fear of losing, or incurring the wrath of your faction mates.
* Expect every trick in the book or ever thought of!
* Take your time. Don´t go for shortcuts – it's the surest way to ruin a promising situation and the rest of your day.
