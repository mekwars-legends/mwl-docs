Physical Combat
===============


In this section we discuss the benefits and dangers of physical combat in Battletech. Melee attacks can decide change the tide of a game when employed properly. 

Why melee?
----------

Melee is a very important aspect in MM and on the Legends server. The speed of units and devices like TSM and melee-weapons in the Jihad era have become more numerous than in earlier ages. Kicks often will be your best bet to catch those nasty 14+hex movers or the 7+jumpers. Or if nothing else just create havoc.

When to melee
-------------

	When is it a good idea to melee and when is it bad? As a general rule you can say that if you play Clan avoid melee like the plague! If you are IS and face Clan, get in there! If you go in the perfect position in a units back watch out for flippy arms! Your unit might get destroyed or fail a PSR for 20+ damage resulting in the loss of your melee chance.

Well melee is even more than the normal game, a game of numbers. The more quantity you have the better are the odds at melee for you. If you can kick thrice and your opponent can only kick once even if it is a heavier unit you are normally on the winning side. Three kicks mean 3 PSRs, and as stated before in this guide, PSR win games. This is even of more importance when facing ultrafast units or long-distance jumpers, if you manage to force a fall on that 7+hex jumper he will be a lot easier to hit next round as he can´t jump and has to spend at least 2 MPs to stand up.

There are units like the TSM Berserker or the TSM Nightsky that are real stars at melee. If you have some of them they can decide games with just one successful melee-attack. These units also draw a lot of attention (virtual “bull’s eye mark” painted on them”) and got to be handled with care but to that later.

Avoiding melee attacks
----------------------

To avoid being on the receiving end of a possible melee attack, there are a few options:

Unit position
	To avoid the chance of a melee attack, consider the placement of your unit. Have you placed your unit in movement range of a brawling unit?
Forcing a PSR
	During the firing phase, attempt to deal 20+ damage to opposing unit to force a PSR. This will gives you the chance that the unit may fall down.

Different kinds of melee
------------------------

When in an adjacent hex to an opposing unit or building you can opt for a melee attack in the physical combat round after firing. Some mechs are predestined for melee attacks: The Melee Specialist (MS) pilot skill also gives +1 on melee attacks

Kicking
~~~~~~~

Kicking is the most basic of the physical attacks. As opposed to other melee attacks kicking also grants a -2 bonus on the THN roll. The Damage inflicted is unit weight/5 and it is only possible with both hip activators working. For example, a 55 ton mech kicks for 11 points of damage.

Nothing stops a light or fast medium unit from harassing you faster than if you kick it with a heavy or assault. As a general rule, do not kick at numbers above 9, especially if you have damaged Gyros or activators. Failing a kick or being kicked forces you to make a PSR. If you have very good pilots (piloting 3 or better) you can almost always afford to kick. If you have the choice between punching a unit, or kicking it with a second unit and manage 20+ damage in total - do the kick. The multiple kicks each force a PSR plus another one for 20 + damage.

Kicking is only possible at targets adjacent and in the 3 front-hexes of your units. Torso-twists have no meaning for kicks. Quads have the ability to kick like a mule, meaning they can kick a unit directly behind them. When using fragile units like lights or thin armored units avoid being kicked at all cost. When going toe to toe with heavies try to get to the sides and backs, avoid the three front hexes.

Punches
~~~~~~~

Punches are a great way to exploit open torsos and arms, plus the occasional headpunch.

The damage delt by punching is Unit weight/10 per punch if hand activators are working. If lacking them then damage is halved, and halved again if underarm is missing or damaged as well.

Punching is a lot more difficult than kicking as it does not get the -2 bonus. However the punch to-hit table operates under a 1-6 scale instead of the to-hit table for weapons which is 1-12. Thise means that a the chance for a HD hit is acheivable on a roll of 6 (16%). 

This does mean that every 6th hit should be a head hit instead of every 36th (as on the weapon to-hit table), and more importantly missing a punch does not force a PSR. 

If you have pretty high numbers for a kick and can´t afford to fall, use punches even if they are 11s and 12s. This is makes TSM mechs of 55 tons or higher predestined to punch, as each hit deals 12+ damage and gets the 16.6 % chance to hit the HD and kill the mech.

Charging
~~~~~~~~

Charging is one of the most devastating attacks one can do on the field but has a high degree of risk. The potential damage of a charge is calculated as Weight/10*crossed hexes - if the attempt is successful. For example: a 30 ton mech charging 10 hexes (hexes crossed not MP used) deals 30 points of damage (30/10 = 3 * 10).

Charging is declared in the movement phase and if you decide to charge you may not fire with that unit during the turn. The charge rolls are determined in the physical phase. Very fast mediums and light are the best chargers as most of the time as they can create the mods to not be hit and can hit the target easier due to the melee bonus they get.

Charging does draw a lot of attention and the charging unit is often your opponents main target for the firing and physical rounds. The risk of charging is both the chance of higher damage recieved and whether or not you will roll high enough. If you want to charge for effect and not as a distraction have patience and wait till you get initiative and an opportunity to charge a back without exposing yourself to fire too much.

A successful charge also displaces the target unit. This can result in forcing it off the map, or into a building or elevation change, resulting in further falling damage.

Death From Above
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Death from above attacks expose your unit to everyone and often the damage dealt isn't worth the risk. There are exceptions though like pushing units from the field by DFA or just to force the target into a field that is not desirable, like Lava :). 

Forcing unit movement occurs when 2 mechs are tryng to occupy the same hex at the same time. For example with a DFA attack, the attacker is landing in the hex occupied by the defender and thus forcing him out. The direction of the forced hex move is the direction the DFA came in from.

As a DFA is effectively landing on an opponent, the damage is applied against the punch table.

Pushing
~~~~~~~

Although pushing does no damage, it can be a game winner. To push a unit you must be facing the target and torso-twist does not apply. You must have both shoulder activators functional and not fired an arm-mounted weapon that turn. Your unit must also be on the same level as the target. 

Melee weapons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Melee weapons are a big asset in the thick of a brawl. The damage applied is calculated by unit weight/5. The biggest gain that melee weapons can hit a target in the back arc if the torso is twisted during weapons phase. Additionally they can reach one level higher or lower than the unit. No PSR is forced if you fail an attack and in most circumstances, melee weapons use the normal weapon table. 


The different intentions of melee
---------------------------------

There are different intentions to for melee attacks. The first and most simple is if you outnumber and outspeed your opponent and have a rather brawly setup. In this case the preference for close-combat is self-explanitory.

The sacrificial lamb 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have a rather trashy unit that is fast or expendable and your other units are vulnerable at this stage, you try to storm - charging his centerpiece unit with your trash. It will either draw fire away from your good units or if ignored it will have a good chance to do a wrecking attack it otherwise won’t be able to perform.

The annoying punches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some units that are capable to jump long distances(7+) and have no arm-mounted weapons are very well suited to rear attacks. Repeated use of this will unnerve your opponent and maybe he will detach one or two units to rearguard those victims you endanger. By doing this you often get the opportunity to keep a large portion of his force occupied while your main force can isolate his other units.




Melee army composition
----------------------

When creating an army with focus on melee like TSM or pulse backstabbers, keep in mind that you should always stick to the rules stated so far in this guide. TSM units work best in pairs. This way they can divide the attention they draw and if you face an opponent with infernos keep the distance between your twins. That way you can switch the heat levels between them as the inferno unit can seldomly shoot at both units. 

When using TSM units with nasty kicks, remember to use them not as Vanguard but as second wave, as they can damage a pristine unit badly but they will cripple or kill a softened up enemy. Use cheap zombies as vanguard if possible. Keep your brawlers and infighters supported and as you close in to your target, your support units should be in at least medium range and in a good position to punch holes and force falling PSRs (prone units can´t kick back ;-)).

.. note:: NEVER build an army composed of only slow brawlers and melee units, they will get torn apart. Speed is your friend in melee armies.
