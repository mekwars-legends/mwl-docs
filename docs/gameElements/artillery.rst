Artillery
=========

Artillery is the use of war devices that can far exceed the range of conventional personal and BattleMech weapons, and is primarily used to support an additional force. Due to the highly explosive nature of artillery, most artillery weapons cause not only substantial primary damage, but also secondary damage to adjacent areas.

Artillery Capabilities by Range
-------------------------------

0 - 6 Hex   =   Indirect Fire Only (Out of LOS) 
7 - 17 hex  =   Direct Fire Range. Indirect fire will land the same turn (after the TAG phase.)
18 > hex  =   Indirect Fire Only. Missiles will land after the TAG phase of the FOLLOWING turn. 

Artillery Ammo
--------------

Artillery comes with a range of different ammunitions, but the two most common are the basic and homing variants. The basic version is free to use at any time, while the homing (e.g. Arrow IV homing, or copperhead artillery rounds), cost extra BV especially when more than one TAGing unit is included in the army. You should not loading more than 10 homing rounds and always keep at least one round of standard ammo in designs with smaller ammo bins. The reasons are: 

1.	Artillery usually provokes a direct reaction in your opponent. They will often charge your formation, which makes the Homing rounds no better than the direct fire, except that you paid BV for it. 
2.	If they close on your artillery units and your TAGers are too far away or disabled - the Homing rounds become useless. It is much more worthwhile to shoot some direct fire rounds while he approaches. This is especially effective to kill fast runners that are normally a difficult target, or BA that get killed automatically as every single trooper takes the whole damage in 5 point clusters. 
3.	Sometimes the enemy retreats beyond the mapsheet range of your homing rounds or it is too dangerous for your TAGers to get close enough to paint up a target. In these cases you lose the homing rounds to no effect. Again BV and ammunition wasted.

Atillery Ammunition
-------------------

Each artillery system can load different types of ammunition. The are pros and cons to each ammunition type.

Standard Ammunition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. csv-table:: Standard Artillery damage
	:header: "Artillery System", "Damage", "Splash Damage", "Additional Splash Damage"

	"Arrow IV", "20", "10"
	"Long Tom", "25", "15", "5"
	"Sniper", "20", "10"
	"Thumper", "15", "5"

Splash Damage

A standard round will splash the the surrounding hexes (and all units in them), with it's Splash. The Long Tom, as it is a big ass gun, forms a second ring of Splash damage.

Homing Ammunition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the Arrow IV system, use Homing Rounds. For the other artillery types, Copperhead Ammo is the homing variety however Copperhead rounds do less damage than the standard shells. Arrow IV Homing damage is the same as the standard ammunition.

.. csv-table:: Homing ammunition damage
	:header: "Homing Ammunition", "Damage"

	"Arrow IV Homing", "20"
	"Long Tom Copperhead", "20"
	"Sniper Copperhead", "10"
	"Thunder Copperhead", "5"

.. note:: Homing rounds do not do splash damage.

To use homing ammo, you need to have units equipped with TAG equipment. When a TAG unit lands a TAG laser hit, the homing round will only need a roll of 4 to hit, regardless of all modifiers. This can be performed with both indirectly fired artillery and with directly fired artillery the turn after the TAG phase.

For indirect fire, a homing round does not have to be directly fired at the target. In truth, homing rounds can hit any TAGed target within 8 hexes of the target hex. That's the other half of the advantage of homing - the round HOMES in on your target on the map in addition to being only a 4 to hit. So there are some tricks you can pull with this. (see below for “Advanced Homing Round Tactics”)

Homing ammo comes with a BV modifier. So you pay a certain amount of BV for every ton of homing ammo equipped, and then multiplied by the number of TAG units in your army.

.. note:: You can only fire an artillery weapon once a turn. So if you fire during the first indirect fire phase, you cannot direct fire with the weapon

Fascam Ammunition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of attacking a target, these rounds drop mines on the targeted hex.

.. todo:: Comment on the other ammo types.

Cluster Ammunition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Cluster ammunition is banned on this Server.* As for most rule violations your opponent may demand that you dump the illegal ammo straight away without using it. This offense is normally not grave enough to justify a surrender, so do not give away the game easily without asking a vet of your Faction, or mod to rule on the issue.
