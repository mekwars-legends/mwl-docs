Triple Strength Myomer (TSM)
==============================

Triple Strength Myomer (TSM), is one of the most useful mech design features in Battletech. Mechs that carry it can run faster and do far more damage with physical attacks when TSM is activated.

In order to gain the benefits of TSM, the mech equipped with it MUST be running at least 9 excess heat. While 9 excess heat is Optimum, you still gain the Physical damage benefit when going over 9 heat. At first, this may seem like a bad idea because overheating your mech by  9 heat causes the mech to slow down and have trouble hitting with weapons fire.

.. note:: If you have a TSM equipped mech, take the time before you use it to calculate how to generate 9 excess heat and how to generate enough heat to keep the mech overheated. If in doubt, ask your faction mates. It will save a lot of time and bother in game if you already have the TSM equipped mech's heat profile figured out to best utilize the TSM.


Benefits of TSM Activation
--------------------------

A TSM equipped mech will not only suffer the normal penalties for being at 9 excess heat, but gain enormous benefits. As well as losing -1 Walking MP (from overheating), the mech will *gain* +2 Walking MP. This results in +1 Walking MP, making the mech move faster. Sadly, all weapon To Hit Rolls will still suffer a +1 BTH. However, the mech's physical attacks will all do double damage.

Activating TSM
--------------

Activating TSM requires you to over-heat the TSM mech by 9 points. If your mech dissipates 10 heat per turn (through heat sinks or by other means), to activate TSM for the next turn you would need to generate 19 heat. This means that the unit starts the next turn with 9 heat *already accrued*. To maintain TSM activation, you would once again need to generate 19 heat.

Example
~~~~~~~

The SCB-9T Scarabus is a TSM equipped light mech of 30 tons. It has 2 Medium Lasers, 2 Small Lasers, a Hatchet and TAG.

The SCB-9T is a great TSM design because of the total heat generation of its weapons while running. Each Medium Laser generates 3 Heat, while each Small Laser generates 1 Heat. When you combine all the weapon heat with 2 Heat for running, the total is 10 Heat - the exact same as the SCB-9T's Total Heat Capacity. This means that once the mech gets to 9 excess Heat, it can run and fire everything it has and not worry about falling below or rising above 9 Heat.

How do you get the SCB to 9 excess Heat? Well, it is a little more complex with this mech because it involves turning off Heat Sinks. The best time to get to 9 excess Heat is as soon as possible. So, for the SCB, when you are deploying it, to turn off 9 Heat Sinks before you hit deploy. Then on the first turn, turn all Heat Sinks back on before the end phase and run and fire all weapons during combat.

With the SCB-9T at 9 Heat, it speeds up. Instead of being a 10/15/0, the SCB is an 11/17/0. With TSM, you just added 2 MP to the mechs Running MP.

As an added benefit, the SCB now deals a lot more damage with its hatchet. Before activating TSM, the hatchet dealt damage equal to the SCB's tonnage divided by 5, or 30/5 = 6 damage. With TSM active, that damage is doubled to 12 damage. Not only is that enough to chop through a lot of armor, but it is enough to destroy the head of any mech in the game. Granted hatchet attacks do not roll on the Punch table for hit location (Which has a 1 in 6 chance of hitting the head) but a physical attack that is potentially deadly with one hit to any mech is a great advantage. 

As long as the SCB stays at 9 Heat, it will move faster and have a very deadly hatchet attack, a small yet very deadly monster on the field.

Weaknesses of TSM
-----------------

Heat management is the most important aspect of using a TSM mech correctly. It is also a very tricky thing to manage. There are a lot of things that can throw a mech's heat off the magic number of 9.

1. Engine damage: An extra 5 heat for the first hit, 10 heat for the second. 
2. Heat sink destruction: A loss of 1 heat capacity for normal heat sinks, 2 heat capacity for double heat sinks. 
3. Flamers: This is very unlikely because most people use flamers to deal damage as they are not very useful in their heat generation mode. They are very useful against TSM mechs though. Be wary of Clan Medium BA - they can over-heat you and keep you too hot to be useful while the mechs pound you into the ground.
4. Inferno SRMs: It is likely that you will see these. Each missile that hits will add 2 heat to the target for that turn. A full salvo can send your TSM mech's heat skyrocketing. If you can, destroy Inferno carrying mech/vees from a distance.
5. Fires: Increase heat for walking through them or standing in them. Turned off on this server, so little to worry about.
6. Volcanoes: If you fall in one, you have bigger things to worry about than heat management.


Inferno SRMs the bane of the TSM mech. But here are some things to think about. No matter how many infernos hit you the max heat you can gain in one round from infernos is 15. If you’re running a TSM it's most likely at 9 plus the max 18 you end up at 24 a very bad place to be high chance of shut down and ammo exploding. 

The physical damage double bonus is based on the heat going into the round not at the end of the round you want to actually do the attack. (you want to kick in round 4 , heat must be 9 or more at the  end of round 3). So if you know you’re running into a batch of infernos one tactic is to not go for the overheat that round. Keep your heat low the infernos will not push you into super overheat and you still get the double damage bonus for that round. You will then live through the round to run away (we hope) and redo the cycle again.

TSM does activate at 9+, not exactly 9. If you are at 10 heat, you will have an additional -1 movement, which will put you back at the mech's normal movement, but retain the 2x damage.

Some TSM mechs do not have neat heat curves like the Scarabus. Good examples of this are the Grim Reaper, Grand Crusader II and several Seraphs. For these mechs, sometimes multiple rounds of fire, turning off HS, and shooting SRMs at the ground are necessary. While others like the TDR 17S are easier to heat-manage: e.g. fire ERPPC, 3MPLs and run and to get the 9 over heat u needed in turn 1. Then you can then either jump 4 and fire all MPLs to maintain the heat or turn off 1 DHS and run and fire all 4 MPLs to maintain heat.

Plasma Rifles, flamers, and Infernos all do a good job of messing with TSM.
