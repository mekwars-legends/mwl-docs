=====================
Choosing a Unit Focus
=====================

Your unit focus will affect the units which you pull from the Quartermaster. They will also usually affect the armies you build, and how you play your game, and may also give you advantages in battle. Think of it as your unit's specialty, the skills that they have trained at relentlessly.

You can read about the different focuses available here: http://www.mekwarslegends.com/Choosing_a_Unit_Focus.html

For more information about how your focus affects your available units, see: ##read about factories.##

.. note:: You may change your unit focus once every 50 xp gained in addition to a one-time change at any xp level. Focus changes must occur at the end of a Tactical Campaign. To do so contact a staff member.
