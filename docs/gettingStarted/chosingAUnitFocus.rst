=====================
Choosing a Unit Focus
=====================

Your unit focus will affect the units which you pull from the Quartermaster and may have additional bonuses when entering or during a battle.

You can read about the different focuses available here: http://www.mekwarslegends.com/Choosing_a_Unit_Focus.html

For more information about how your focus affects your available units, see: ##read about factories.##

.. note:: You may change your unit focus once every 50 xp gained in addition to a one-time change at any xp level. Focus changes must occur at the end of a Tactical Campaign. To do so contact a staff member.
