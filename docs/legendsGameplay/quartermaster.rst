The Quartermaster
=================

Factions control planets, some planets have factories. Factories produce units.

The Quartermaster (QM), is your interface to purchase units from what is available to your faction.

Pulling Units
-------------

As Mekwars Legends does not have a purchasing system, purchasing units is referred to as 'pulling'.

Click on the Quartermaster tab on the MWL client. You will note a long list of units and their factories. To pull a unit, click the 'Buy' button. You can then select what type of unit you wish to purchase.

The unit you purchase is random, however it is influenced by the factory and variant weights which you'll also see in the Quartermaster detail section.

After purchasing a unit, the unit will appear in your hangar. If you purchased a Mek, you'll also need to hire a pilot. You do this via the Campaign > Personel > Hire Pilots
 menu. Note that other unit types (vehicles and battle armor), already come with an able crew.

For more information on managing pilots, see `legendsGameplay/pilots`_.
