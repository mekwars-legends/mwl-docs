Hiring Pilots
-------------

After you purchased your units you will need to man your machines. Vehicles and BA come equipped with pilots, but Battlemechs don´t. To purchase pilots click on the Campaign tab, select Personnel, then Pilots and then Hire Pilots. For every weight class you can buy a maximum of 5 pilots in one go, so you will have to repeat the process until you bought enough pilots for all your mechs.

Make sure that you buy exactly as many pilots as mechs! Then you buy exactly 5 more of each weight class. The rationale behind this is that your pilots will gain experience in battle and develop new skills. While this is in general positive it also has its downside. So called 'leveled pilots' (like 4/4) multiply the BV of the unit they occupy. While the benefits and drawbacks of superior piloting skills are a matter of heated discussion, it has to be said that the raise in BV cost is often enormous. Taken too far it will result in your units becoming too expensive and having to face superior numbers (wearing more armor in total per army) at the same BV.

By keeping a supply of regular pilots you reserve yourself the choice of swapping those 'overprized/overbv´ed' pilots and keep your army BVs competitive.
